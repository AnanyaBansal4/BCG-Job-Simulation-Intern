# BCG-Job-Simulation-Intern

This is the GenAI Job Simulation by BCG that I completed in September, 2024. 
The basic objectives were: 
- Data extraction and initial analysis
- Developing an AI-powered financial chatbot

At the beginning, I was briefed by BCG experts via video explanations and online resources, which helped me learn more about the 10-K,10-Q reports, data analysis and generative AI. 
I gained insights about income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, excel & spreadsheet tools, feature engineering, data encoding and formatting, dealing with time series data and AI Chatbot development (including NLP).

To implement this knowledge, I was given two tasks-
**TASK 1:**
- Research & review 10-K documents for 3 companies
- Extract the relevant data (financial figures & ratios)
- Analyse the data by identifying financial trends and indicators and assessing financial health and performance.
- Format & clean the data for AI model integration
- Develop a python model to calculate values and analyze the given data, and show your findings.

**TASK 2:**
- Use the above data to develop a basic AI financial chatbot, to answer user queries related to those 3 companies based on pre-determined responses.
- Provide a summary of the ChatBot developed.

I was then told how we can further integrate complex calculations, code and technologies to make the chatbot more comprehensive, training it to remember past conversations and learn from them.
